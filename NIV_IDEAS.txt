===============================================================================
NIV IDEAS — AMP Full Roadmap (Features + AI Agents)
===============================================================================
Last updated: 2026-02-19 | Session 20

===============================================================================
PART 1: OVERVIEW — AGENTS VS AUTOMATIONS
===============================================================================

AUTOMATIONS (If X then Y):
- Fixed rules, no thinking, no adaptation
- Trigger -> always the same action
- Tools: Cron, pg_cron, Supabase triggers, Zapier, Make
- Example: "Lead not touched 3 days -> send alert"

AI AGENTS (Understand -> Decide -> Act):
- Receive context, decide what to do dynamically
- Adapt action to person, situation, timing
- Combine info from multiple sources
- Example: "Read personality + transcripts + history -> write personalized message"

KEY DIFFERENCES:
| Aspect       | Automation      | AI Agent              |
|------------- |---------------- |---------------------- |
| Thinking     | None            | Analyzes & decides    |
| Personalize  | Template-based  | Per-case adapted      |
| Context      | Single field    | Multi-source          |
| Creativity   | None            | Creates new content   |
| Cost         | Almost free     | API calls             |
| Reliability  | 100% predictable| Needs supervision     |

===============================================================================
PART 2: FULL AGENT LIST — NIV'S SELECTION (14 AGENTS)
===============================================================================

    * WINNER with HIGH churn + no results in 3 weeks = RED ALERT
    * ANCHOR who feels instability = RED ALERT
  - Generates rescue plan per client:
    * Personalized retention offer
    * Communication adjustment
    * Risk level (red/yellow/green)
  - Dashboard widget: "3 clients at risk this week"
Tech: Cron -> Edge Function -> scans clients, transcripts, retainer_changes -> Gemini

AGENT #15: Upsell Matchmaker (Service Opportunity Finder)
Type: AI Agent (Level 3)
Trigger: Weekly scan (Cron)
What it does:
  - Analyzes all clients and leads for upsell/cross-sell opportunities:
    * Client A buys only SEO but competitors invest in PPC -> "suggest PPC"

  - Personality-aware framing:
    * WINNER: "ROI proven, you'll beat the competition"
    * HEART: "complete package that makes your life easier"

---------- WAVE 3: Advanced System (Week 5-8) ----------

AGENT #20: AI Notebook / Context Brain (NEW — Niv's idea)
Type: AI Agent (Level 3)
Trigger: On-demand (ask a question) + auto-update on new data
What it does:
  - Central knowledge per client: meeting summaries, protocols, deals, scripts
  - Understands context across time:
    * "In January meeting client said X, in February changed to Y"
    * "Client always complains about delivery times"
  - Like Google NotebookLM built into CRM
  - Ask it: "What does this client want?" -> summarizes from ALL sources
  - Auto-generates timeline of all interactions
  - Per-client "brain" that remembers everything
Tech: Vector store (Supabase pgvector) + Embeddings (Gemini) + RAG retrieval
DB: client_context_embeddings (client_id, source_type, source_id, embedding, text_chunk)
Note: Most complex agent — needs vector store / embedding infrastructure
      Could start simpler: just concatenate recent notes+transcripts and send to Gemini
      Phase 1: simple context window, Phase 2: true RAG with embeddings
Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH — transformative but complex

AGENT #10: Monthly Strategist (Big Picture Analyst)
Type: AI Agent (Level 3)

    * "HEART leads who received a personal call: 85% conversion"
    * "After 5 days without contact: conversion drops to 15%"
  - Builds optimized playbooks:
    * "Playbook for converting WINNER leads" -> steps, timing, messages
    * "Playbook for retaining ANCHOR clients" -> touchpoints, offers
  - Auto-updates playbooks when new data accumulates
Tech: Cron (monthly) -> Edge Function -> queries leads/clients/deals history -> Gemini
DB: playbooks table (archetype, stage, steps, metrics, updated_at)
Priority: LOW initially — needs enough conversion data to learn from

AGENT #18: Smart Scheduler (When + How to Reach Out)
Type: AI Agent (Level 3)
Trigger: Daily morning scan
What it does:
  - Decides WHEN is the best time to contact each lead/client:

  - Responds to clients on WhatsApp/Instagram at 11 PM
  - Closes appointments, updates CRM, summarizes conversations
  - Morning briefing: "You have 3 new appointments, 1 hot lead, here's the summary"
  - User can modify: type in a box -> system adapts
Vision:
  - Client writes on Instagram at 11 PM interested in a product
  - Agent asks the right questions, understands needs, closes appointment
  - Next morning: appointment in calendar, lead in CRM, conversation summary ready
  - You wake up and know exactly what the client wants before picking up the phone
Tech: Agent Orchestrator + all previous agents as API + WhatsApp Business API

===============================================================================
PART 5: NEW DB TABLES NEEDED
===============================================================================

===============================================================================
PART 6: WHAT ALREADY EXISTS IN AMP (Foundation)
===============================================================================

Already working as "agents" (even if not called that):
  - AI Recommendations from Signals PDF      -> Gemini analyzes + generates
  - Personality-aware WhatsApp messages       -> adapts to archetype
  - PDF personality extraction                -> structures JSON from report
  - Audio transcription + summary             -> Gemini listens + summarizes
  - Document summarization (Knowledge Base)   -> reads PDF + classifies
  - Receipt scanning                          -> Vision extracts data
  - Auto-trigger recommendations from webhook -> useEffect automation

Missing infrastructure:
  - pg_cron (scheduled jobs)
  - Agent Orchestrator (queue + tracking)
  - Notification system (in-app + push)
  - Pipeline connecting agents to each other
  - "AI Command Center" dashboard page

===============================================================================
PART 7: NIV'S NEW FEATURES (Session 20 — 2026-02-19)
===============================================================================

8 new feature ideas + Signals OS V2 sync. Build order below.

---------- STEP 0: Signals OS V2 Sync (PREREQUISITE) ----------

PROBLEM: Signals OS upgraded to Business Intelligence V2 (5-door scripts,
hero cards, action items, domain awareness) but AMP still uses old basic
personality reception. AMP is missing the entire V2 layer.

WHAT'S MISSING IN AMP:
  - business_intel_v2 JSONB field in signals_personality table
  - lang + questionnaire_version columns
  - TypeScript interfaces: HeroCard, ActionItem, QuickScript, ScriptDoor,
    FullFiveDoorScript, ProfileBriefing, BusinessIntelV2
  - Webhook handler doesn't store V2 data
  - UI doesn't display: hero card, 5-door script, action items, quick script
  - Domain awareness system (7 categories in Signals OS)
  - V2 prompt builders for generating business intelligence

WHAT TO DO:
  1. DB migration: ADD business_intel_v2 JSONB, lang TEXT, questionnaire_version TEXT
  2. Update signals-webhook Edge Function to store V2 fields
  3. Add V2 interfaces to types.ts
  4. Build UI components: HeroCard, ScriptDoors, ActionItems, QuickScript
  5. Copy domain system from Signals OS categoryDomains.ts

SIGNALS OS V2 STRUCTURE:
  Layer 1 — Quick Scan (30 seconds):
    - HeroCard: profileLine, archetype, riskLevel, priorityStars, closeRate
    - 3 ActionItems: priority + action + why + how
    - QuickScript: opener, keyQuestion, closeLine
    - RedFlags: 3-4 deal-killers per archetype

  Layer 2 — Deep Dive (5 minutes):
    - FullFiveDoorScript:
      Door 1: Opening (Ice Breaker + Accusation Audit)
      Door 2: Deep Listening (Mirroring + Labeling + Validation)
      Door 3: The Offer (archetype-adapted + domain-aware)
      Door 4a: If Yes -> warm close + scheduling
      Door 4b: If Hesitant -> FOMO per archetype
      Door 5a: Objection Fear -> empathy + reality check
      Door 5b: Objection Price -> mirroring + value reframe
    - ProfileBriefing: whoIsThis, strengths, weaknesses, goalForCall
    - PostCallChecklist: 4-5 action items
    - RetentionNotes

---------- FEATURE #7: Dynamic Services (Multi-Business) ----------

Priority: 1 (Build first)
Current: INITIAL_SERVICES hardcoded in constants.ts for ad agencies only
Goal: Any business type can define their own services

What to build:
  - CRUD for services in Settings (add/edit/delete/reorder)
  - Each service: name, default_price, category, color, icon
  - Template import: agency, fitness, real-estate, coaching, etc.
  - Each tenant picks their business type on first setup
  - Business type affects AI prompts, PDF templates, terminology
  - DB: services table (tenant_id, name, price, category, color, sort_order)

---------- FEATURE #8: Purchase History + LTV ----------

Priority: 2
Current: deals + payments exist but no unified history view
Goal: Per-client purchase history timeline + LTV calculation

What to build:
  - "Purchase History" block in ClientProfile
  - Timeline table: date, description, amount, type (deal/retainer/payment)
  - LTV calculation: total deals + cumulative retainer + payments
  - Trend chart (monthly revenue per client)
  - LTV badge/indicator on client cards and table
  - For non-agency businesses: product/service purchase tracking

---------- FEATURE #2: Dynamic Call Script (5-Door System) ----------

Priority: 3
Depends on: Step 0 (Signals V2 sync)
Source: Copy from Signals OS businessIntelV2.ts

What to build:
  - Dedicated block in LeadProfile + ClientProfile
  - If V2 data exists from webhook: display structured 5-door script
  - If no V2 data: generate on-demand via Gemini using personality + context
  - Collapsible doors with sub-topics:
    * Mirroring technique
    * Framing / reframing
    * FOMO creation per archetype
    * Objection handling scripts
  - Adapt to business domain (not just agencies)

---------- FEATURE #5: PDF Analysis + Work Plan ----------

Priority: 4
Source: Copy PDF generation method from Signals OS (generatePdf.ts + heeboFont.ts)

What to build:
  - 2 PDF document types:
    1. "Current State Analysis" — AI analyzes all lead data, transcripts, notes
    2. "Work Plan Proposal" — AI generates strategy, services, timeline, pricing
  - PDF design (based on Niv's reference document):
    * Business logo at top (tenant's logo OR client's logo)
    * Color palette configurable per tenant in Settings
    * Clean Hebrew RTL layout with Heebo font
    * Sections with headers, content blocks, tables
    * Professional footer with agency name + date
  - Branding system:
    * Logo upload in Settings (stored in storage bucket)
    * Color palette picker (primary, secondary, accent)
    * Future businesses can set their own logo + colors
  - Method: window.print() with hidden HTML (proven method from Signals OS)
  - Edge Function generates content, frontend renders + prints to PDF
  - Option to combine both documents into single PDF
  - Available from LeadProfile after intro call + notes/transcript

---------- FEATURE #3: Competitor Scout (Auto Analysis) ----------

Priority: 5
Same as Agent #19 from AI Army roadmap

What to build:
  - Block in LeadProfile + ClientProfile
  - AI extracts competitors from area/industry
  - Competitor report: who, what, strengths, weaknesses, online presence
  - FOMO message adapted to archetype (WINNER/STAR/DREAMER/HEART/ANCHOR)
  - Edge Function + external search API (SerpAPI / Google Custom Search)
  - Manual trigger button + auto-trigger on new lead (optional)

---------- FEATURE #4: AI Notebook (Context Brain) ----------

Priority: 6
Same as Agent #20 from AI Army roadmap

What to build:
  Phase 1 (Simple):
    - Chat interface per client/lead in profile
    - "Ask anything" text box
    - Backend: concatenate all notes + transcripts + recommendations + V2 data
    - Send to Gemini with question -> return answer
    - Shows sources (which note/transcript the answer came from)
  Phase 2 (Advanced):
    - pgvector extension in Supabase
    - Embeddings per text chunk (notes, transcripts, deals)
    - RAG retrieval for more accurate answers
    - Auto-generate timeline of all interactions

---------- FEATURE #1: Telegram Voice Commands → CRM ----------

Priority: 7 (Most complex)

What to build:
  - Telegram Bot (Node.js / Deno) connected to Supabase
  - Voice message flow:
    1. User sends voice message in Telegram
    2. Bot sends audio to Gemini for transcription
    3. AI Router analyzes intent:
       - "Note about client X" -> creates client_note/lead_note
       - "Meeting on date Y" -> creates calendar_event
       - "Call client Z" -> creates task/reminder
       - "Idea for client W" -> creates idea
    4. Entity recognition: matches client/lead names from DB
    5. Date parsing: Hebrew date expressions ("עוד שבועיים", "ב-1 למרץ")
    6. Confirmation message back in Telegram
  - Screenshot/image flow:
    1. User sends screenshot in Telegram
    2. AI classifies: competitor screenshot, design idea, receipt, other
    3. Routes to correct section (ideas, competitors, expenses)
  - Text command flow:
    1. User types text command
    2. Same AI Router processes and routes
  - Auth: Telegram user linked to AMP user via settings
  - Edge Function: telegram-webhook (receives updates from Telegram Bot API)

---------- FEATURE #6: Salesforce/Monday Features ----------

Priority: 8 (Ongoing, build alongside other features)

Already have: Kanban pipelines, activity timeline, task management (calendar),
  notes, file attachments, dashboards, custom fields

What to add over time:
  - Automations (Wave 1 agents handle this)
  - Email integration (send/receive from CRM)
  - Advanced reports with filters + export
  - Custom views per user (saved filters)
  - Workflow templates (lead stages with auto-actions)
  - Bulk actions (mass email, mass status change)
  - Custom fields per tenant (dynamic form builder)
