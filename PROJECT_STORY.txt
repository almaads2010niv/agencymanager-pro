SESSION 1 (2026-02-14) - Audit & Bug Fixes
===============================================================================

WHAT HAPPENED:
User asked to investigate the codebase for broken/problematic things.
Full audit was performed, identifying 19 issues across 4 severity levels.

ISSUES FOUND & FIXED:
1. [CRITICAL] `any` types everywhere -> Created proper DB row interfaces
   (ClientRow, LeadRow, DealRow, ExpenseRow, PaymentRow, SettingsRow)
2. [CRITICAL] JSON.parse without try-catch -> Created `safeJsonParse` helper
3. [CRITICAL] Non-atomic convertLeadToClient -> Added rollback on failure
4. [HIGH] Debug console.logs in supabaseClient.ts -> Removed
5. [HIGH] STORAGE_KEY dead code in constants.ts -> Removed
6. [HIGH] No error feedback to user -> Added error/clearError to DataContext,
   error toast in Dashboard
7. [HIGH] `isLoaded` not exposed from context -> Added to DataContextType
8. [MEDIUM] Native confirm() dialogs -> Styled Modal confirmations in
   Clients.tsx, Leads.tsx, Debts.tsx
9. [MEDIUM] Missing custom-scrollbar CSS class -> Added to index.html <style>
10. [MEDIUM] RTL margin issues (ml/mr) -> Fixed to logical ms/me in Button.tsx
11. [MEDIUM] Modal z-index conflict with sidebar -> z-50 -> z-[60]
12. [MEDIUM] Accessibility: Added role, aria-modal, aria-label to Modal.tsx
13. [MEDIUM] Accessibility: Added aria-labels to Layout.tsx sidebar buttons
14. [MEDIUM] Login.tsx responsive issues -> Fixed width/padding
15. [MEDIUM] Login.tsx mixed Hebrew/English text -> Unified
16. [MEDIUM] Settings.tsx RTL toggle animation -> Fixed translate direction
17. [MEDIUM] Settings.tsx missing FileReader.onerror -> Added
18. [MEDIUM] Settings.tsx typo "דרוס" -> "דורס"
19. [LOW] Typed all component props (KPICardProps, SidebarItemProps)

FILES MODIFIED:
- lib/supabaseClient.ts (removed debug logs)
- constants.ts (removed STORAGE_KEY)
- contexts/DataContext.tsx (major rewrite: types, error handling, async)
- components/ui/Modal.tsx (z-index, accessibility)
- components/ui/Button.tsx (RTL fix)
- components/Login.tsx (responsive, accessibility, text)
- components/Settings.tsx (RTL toggle, error handling, typo)
- components/Layout.tsx (typed props, aria-labels)

- components/Clients.tsx (confirm delete modal)
- components/Leads.tsx (confirm convert modal)
- components/Debts.tsx (confirm delete modal, aria-labels)
- index.html (custom-scrollbar CSS)

DELETED:

Build verified: `npm run build` succeeded.
Committed: 443c937 - "Fix 19 audit issues..."
Pushed to GitHub -> Vercel auto-deployed.

ARCHITECTURE NOTES
===============================================================================

Data Flow:
  Supabase (PostgreSQL) <-> DataContext.tsx <-> Components
  DB uses snake_case, TypeScript uses camelCase
  Transform functions handle conversion both ways

Component Structure:
  App.tsx (router + auth)
    -> Layout.tsx (sidebar + main area)
      -> [Page Components] (Dashboard, Clients, Leads, etc.)
        -> ui/ (Button, Card, Form, Modal, Badge, Table)

State Management:
  Single React Context (DataContext) holds all app state
  All CRUD operations are async with try/catch + error toast
  No external state libraries (Redux, Zustand, etc.)

Auth:
  Supabase Auth (email/password)
  Session check on App mount
  Role system: AuthContext.tsx with admin/viewer roles
  First user auto-becomes admin, subsequent users get viewer role
  Role table: user_roles (user_id, role, display_name)

Styling:
  Tailwind CSS via CDN (not PostCSS build)
  Custom config in index.html <script> tag
  Dark theme: background #0B1121, surface #151e32
  Glass morphism effects throughout
  RTL: use logical properties (ms-/me- not ml-/mr-)

Key Patterns:
  - Modal z-index: z-[60] (above sidebar z-50)
  - custom-scrollbar CSS class in index.html
  - Hebrew localized dates, currency, text
  - DB row interfaces for type safety
  - safeJsonParse helper for crash-safe JSON
  - Atomic operations with rollback support
  - Confirm modals for destructive actions
